# A simple setup to learn React

<code>
npm i && npm start
</code>

I plan to build example components for you to play around with. This is a quick setup to play around with React at localhost, don't use it for production. For that I recommend you to have a look at Gatsby or something similar.

I plan to include examples of class components, functional components, different hooks, styled components, redux and more.

In src/scss you can build your scss if you like. I've imported tailwind here so you can easily switch to what you like, this is not a recommended way to work with tailwind or css in general. Like I said, this is not for production but to practice React. There will be examples of styled-components also. All these examples can be a mess but a fast way to see some examples if you are interested.
